# Parallel and distributed computing
The aim of teaching the discipline is 
- Familiarization of students with the basic methods of parallel data processing and their impact on the technical performance of parallel computing systems; 
- Basic principles of construction and operation of modern parallel computing mono- and multisystems; 
- Specifics of numerical specification and visualization of parallel time models, modern programming technologies.

# Planned learning outcomes:

To know

- methods of parallel data processing;
- parallel algorithms;
- parallel processes;
- performance indicators of parallel implementation of algorithms and programs;
- principles of construction and architecture of modern parallel computing mono- and multi-systems.
  
Be able to:
- form approaches to the conscious application of methods of automated software development of parallel computing systems;
- create numerical specifications of parallel programs, evaluate their performance indicators, visualize parallel static and dynamic objects.
